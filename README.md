<b>Alive Studios</b><br>
The overview of our project is to create a web application that promotes digital wellness by encouraging users to reflect on and develop healthier digital habits. Through interactive quizzes, visual storytelling, and dynamic feedback systems, the application transforms the abstract concept of digital balance into an engaging and emotionally relatable experience. The name of our app is called Digi Bloom.<br>

<b>Design Process</b><br>
Technology is deeply integrated into daily life, yet many individuals lack awareness and knowledge about digital wellness. Excessive screen time, digital overload, and unhealthy online behaviours have become increasingly common issues. Digi Bloom addresses this by creating an interactive experience that educates users while keeping them engaged through gamification.
<br>
There are two main characters of our app.
<ul>
    <li>The Girl represents the user and healthy digital habits.</li>
    <li>The Robot represents digital addiction and negative digital behaviours.</li>
</ul><br>
By representing healthy habits as a girl and digital addiction as a robot, users can visually see the consequences of their actions through progress bars and background changes.<br>
We started to design our wireframe so we can have a rough idea of how our app would look like as well as how many pages we am going to do.<br>
We first did some sketches then we started our low and high fidelity wireframe on figma.<br>
Below is our wireframe link:<br>

Afterwards we began to code our layout on website and used css style and java script to complete our pages.<br>
<br>

<b> Acknowledgements</b><br>
-	Digi Bloom incorporates ideas inspired by familiar digital systems to enhance usability and engagement. The quiz questions that link to update of progress bar drew inspiration from games where one need to be strong to defeat the other.<br>
-	Digi Bloom also draws inspiration from wellness and habit tracking apps, where progress is visualised through simple indicators such as bars, colour changes, and milestones. The use of calming and dark background transitions is influenced by these systems, helping users understand their current state of digital balance without relying on complex instructions.
